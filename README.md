#  OracleMind - AI Data Oracle & Validation Layer for Somnia

**OracleMind is a foundational infrastructure project for the Somnia AI Hackathon, building a robust and verifiable data oracle specifically designed for on-chain autonomous AI agents.**

> Autonomous AI agents operating on the Somnia blockchain require access to reliable, real-world data to make informed decisions. This project solves the fundamental "oracle problem" by providing a secure and validated bridge between the off-chain world and Somnia's on-chain AI agents, unlocking a new dimension of intelligent, autonomous capabilities.

## Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the end-to-end flow of a data request, from the user interacting with the dApp to the final data delivery.

    participant AIAgent as MockAIAgent (Consumer)
    participant Oracle as SomniaOracle (Contract)
    participant Service as Off-chain Service
    participant ExternalAPI as External API (e.g., Weather)

    User->>+Frontend: 1. Enter data source & params

## Core Functionality

1.  **Decentralized Data Requests:** AI agents on Somnia request off-chain data (e.g., weather, market prices) through the `SomniaOracle` smart contract.
2.  **Off-chain Validation:** A Node.js service listens for requests, fetches data from external sources, and performs validation to ensure integrity.
3.  **Secure On-chain Fulfillment:** The validated data is pushed back to the `SomniaOracle`, which delivers it to the requesting AI agent via a callback.
4.  **Enhanced AI Capabilities:** By providing verifiable external data, OracleMind empowers Somnia's AI agents to operate with greater intelligence and relevance to real-world events.
