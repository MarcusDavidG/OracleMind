## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Terminal 1: Oracle Service
```bash
cd contracts/oracle-service
npm run start
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Oracle Service Address: 0x...
Connected to Somnia RPC: https://dream-rpc.somnia.network/
Listening for DataRequested events...
```

### Terminal 2: Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output**:
```
▲ Next.js 15.5.3 (Turbopack)
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
✓ Ready in 2.6s
```

### Access the dApp
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## 🌐 Deploying to Vercel

### Quick Steps:

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Visit https://vercel.com/new
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Set **Root Directory** to: `frontend`
   - Click **Deploy**

3. **Done!** Your frontend will be live at `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### Alternative: Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Oracle Service Hosting
The oracle service **CANNOT** run on Vercel because:
- It's a long-running Node.js process
- Vercel is for serverless functions and static sites

**Recommended hosting platforms**:
- Railway (https://railway.app) - Easy deployment
- Render (https://render.com) - Free tier available
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- AWS EC2 or any VPS
- Heroku (worker dyno)

### Security
- ✅ `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Private keys are not committed
- ⚠️ For production, use environment variables from hosting platform
- ⚠️ Never expose private keys in frontend code

### Network Configuration
- **Chain ID**: 50312
- **Network Name**: Somnia Testnet
- **RPC URL**: https://dream-rpc.somnia.network/
- **Currency**: SOMI
- **Block Explorer**: https://dream-rpc.somnia.network/explorer
